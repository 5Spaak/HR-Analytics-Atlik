# HR Analytics AtliQ

1. Problem Statement

In this project, we'll take a real dataset and see how a data analyst thinks and reflects. The data we'll use comes from AtliQ, a software and data solutions company. It will provide us with employee attendance data. We have three months of data. We have the dates in the columns and the employee names in the rows.
