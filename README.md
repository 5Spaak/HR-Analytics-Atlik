# HR Analytics AtliQ

**1. Problem Statement**

In this project, we'll take a real dataset and see how a data analyst thinks and reflects. The data we'll use comes from AtliQ, a software and data solutions company. It will provide us with employee attendance data. We have three months of data. We have the dates in the columns and the employee names in the rows.

2. Understanding Requirement.

In this section we'll use the data (Excel file) provided by AtliQ's HR manager and try to understand her needs.


As a data analyst, it's important that we listen more than you talk. In this particular phase, we need to keep the customer fully engaged by asking good questions. It's also an opportunity for us to become their strategic partner rather than just a solution provider.


Ask questions to understand their short- and long-term plans and align your solutions accordingly.
